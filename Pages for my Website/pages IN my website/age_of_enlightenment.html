        The Age of Enlightenment was a time period of great intellectual & philosophical 
        movement between early 16th to early 19th Century. It is also known as the "Age 
        of Reason". The Enlightenment scholars valued the knowledge gained by inquiry and
        sensory experience, also known as "Empiricism".It also gave birth to 
        many social & political ideals like equality, tolerance and 
        freedom of expression.

        The Age of Enlightenment commenced and overlapped with the end of The Scientific 
        Revolution. Many influential scholars and philosophers (also called as "philosophe"
        in French) like Voltaire, Montesqiueu, Sir Francis Bacon and Rene Descartes, with
        their treatises on philosophy, politics and religion spread the ideas of freedom,
        tolerance and supported the questioning of established beliefs and investigation of
        things and events i.e phenomena to gain knowledge. Philosophers like Immanuel Kant
        further fueled this by stating in one of his works, "Sapere Aude"- Dare to know.
